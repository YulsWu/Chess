Changed BoardMaker functionality:
- Done button now outputs all bitboards, the flagged indicies of the bitboard longs, and the returnPieceboards
- Done clears the current list of bitboards and boards, continues execution
- Changed generateCheckEvasionMoves() in the way it prevents self-checking moves from being suggested
- Added generateEnPassentMask(int playerSign, int origin) to return a 1 bit en passent mask for a pawn at origin
    - Uses W_PAWN_ATTACK and B_PAWN_ATTACK and checks occupancy and move history

- Added setMoveQueue() to board for testing
- Added generatePawnAttackMask(int playerSign, int origin)
    - Uses W/B_PAWN_ATTACK and generateEnPassantMask in conjunction with board occupancy to provide valid pawn attack masks
- Modified generatePieceAttackMask()
    - Replaced pawn move generation with generatePawnAttack()
    - Modified Illegal move checker at the end of the function to also test for en passent moves

- Added test.generateCheckEvasionTest() to test many board positions with varying states, exitCode
- Added test.generateEnPassentMaskTest() to test en passent generation
