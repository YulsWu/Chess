validateMove() currently calls generateValidMoves() to validate the supplied move, but evaluateGameEndConditions() takes valid moves as a parameter, causing additional redundant valid move set generations
- Either edit validateMove() to take validMoves as a parameter, or somehow share the valid moves list between the two functions.
- Perhaps an overarching method that combines validateMove(), playMove(), updateState(), and evaluateGameEndConditions()

Statically write masks for move generation rather than generating them programmatically
