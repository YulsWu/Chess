Board history:
NOT using memento - Not all attributes relating to history are strictly for history, many are for game logic as well.
because of this it wouldn't make sense to use a memento:

1. If I split the attributes up between board and memento, then both board and memento would have to have methods
for restoring state from history, fragmenting the responsiblity between two classes

2. If I put ALL attributes into memento, then I would have to use memento and caretaker at each step of the game
loop to update the state of the board, again fragmenting the game logic responsiblity between these two

3. I don't need a deep history, for chess games we only go forward or back once, and if I want to go back to a specific
point (or if I want to fast forward a replay), I would just invoke forward or back n times until I get there. Game logic
right now is very fast and this wouldn't incur significant time cost

Board logic related histories:
Many attributes only used the most recent object in the history, but still it doesn't make sense to Duplicate
these attributes with "XHistory" in memento, and then "lastX" in board.
- playedMoves is tied to board state updating
- boardHistory tied to move type recognition after the move has been played
- stateHistory to determine valid moves depending on board state (if player is in CHECK)
- zobristHistory for repeated position draws
- epHashHistory for zobrist hash generation
